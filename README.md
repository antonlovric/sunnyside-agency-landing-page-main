## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS
- And a pinch of JavaScript :)

### What I learned

This project was a really good exercise for my layout skills. Creating a custom mobile menu was also very useful as it posed a different challenge. It's always good to stay sharp with SASS as it is a very useful tool. On top of all of that this website has a very clean design and I might draw some inspiration from it in the future.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Triangle](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/css-triangle/) - Creating a triangle for the mobile menu is pretty simple, but this tutorial opened my eyes even more :)
